# **Potential User Stories for AI-driven Wildfire Prediction**

### **1. Parent or Guardian**
- **As a parent/guardian,** I want an AI system that can predict wildfire risks and provide early warnings **so that** I can take preventive actions to protect my family and ensure they stay safe in case of an approaching wildfire.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - The AI system uses real-time data (weather patterns, forest conditions, historical wildfire data) to predict wildfire risks.
      - The system provides early warnings of potential wildfire threats in my area via push notifications or alerts.
      - The system has a visual map that highlights areas with high wildfire risk, showing safe evacuation routes and shelter locations.
      - The system can integrate with local emergency services to provide real-time updates and evacuation instructions.
      - The system is accessible through a mobile app, and notifications are sent instantly if the wildfire risk increases or a fire breaks out.

### **2. Someone Without a Driver’s License**
- **As someone without a driver’s license,** I want an AI-powered wildfire prediction system that can alert me about nearby fires and help me find evacuation options **so that** I can evacuate quickly and safely without relying on personal transportation.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - The AI system uses predictive models to identify areas at risk of wildfires based on environmental and weather conditions.
      - The system provides clear, easy-to-understand alerts indicating whether a wildfire is near or expected in the coming hours/days.
      - The system suggests safe evacuation routes and alternative transportation options (e.g., public transport, nearby shelters).
      - The system allows users to input their location and receives notifications about fire risks in that area, as well as evacuation recommendations.
      - The system can provide real-time updates on air quality and fire conditions, helping users make informed decisions about evacuation.

### **3. Emergency Services**
- **As an emergency services provider,** I want an AI system that can predict wildfires and optimize resource allocation for firefighting and evacuations **so that** we can respond faster, prevent loss of life, and minimize the damage caused by wildfires.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - The AI system uses historical data, weather forecasts, and satellite imagery to predict where wildfires are likely to occur and how they will spread.
      - The system can provide forecasts for the size, speed, and direction of wildfires, helping to allocate firefighting resources in advance.
      - The system integrates with fire department databases and emergency response systems to give real-time updates about fire progress, areas under threat, and areas needing immediate evacuation.
      - The system can suggest evacuation zones, shelter locations, and safe routes for both civilians and emergency responders.
      - The system has an API for emergency services to access predictive wildfire models, fire locations, and resource distribution information to aid in decision-making.

### **4. Local Government Official**
- **As a local government official,** I want an AI-driven wildfire prediction and risk management system **so that** I can make informed policy decisions on wildfire prevention, allocate resources effectively, and ensure public safety.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - The system provides long-term wildfire risk assessments based on climate data, land use patterns, and forest conditions.
      - The system offers recommendations for creating buffer zones, firebreaks, and controlled burns to mitigate wildfire risks.
      - The system tracks wildfire seasonality and trends, helping officials prepare better for peak wildfire seasons.
      - The system generates reports on the effectiveness of current prevention strategies and provides suggestions for future improvements.
      - The system includes an interactive dashboard for monitoring real-time wildfire predictions, active fires, and response strategies.

### **5. Environmental Researcher**
- **As an environmental researcher,** I want an AI system that analyzes ecological data and predicts wildfire behavior **so that** I can study the impacts of wildfires on ecosystems and develop strategies for wildfire prevention and forest management.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - The system integrates environmental data such as vegetation density, moisture levels, and soil conditions to assess wildfire risk.
      - The system uses AI models to simulate the spread of wildfires based on different environmental and weather conditions.
      - The system allows researchers to study past wildfire events and analyze their ecological impact, such as species loss and habitat destruction.
      - The system provides insights into the correlation between climate change, land use, and wildfire frequency.
      - The system allows researchers to propose and test different wildfire prevention strategies using AI simulations.
