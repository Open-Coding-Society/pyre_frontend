# AI-Powered Wildfire Prediction & Mitigation Project

## Project Overview
We're building a machine learning application that uses satellite imagery, sensor networks, and weather data to enhance wildfire detection and mitigation capabilities. Our goal is to reduce wildfire detection time by 40% and improve prediction accuracy by 30% through AI-enhanced detection systems, spread prediction, and resource optimization.

## Scope → Community → Team → Research → Ideate

### Who / What / Initial Concept and Idea
- **Who**: Wildfire management agencies, local communities in fire-prone regions, emergency responders
- **What**: AI-powered wildfire detection and prediction system using multi-source data integration
- **Initial Concept**: Create a system that combines satellite imagery, ground sensor data, and weather models to detect wildfires earlier and predict their spread with greater accuracy

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. How can we reduce the latency in satellite-based fire detection systems?
2. What methods can improve detection through smoke and cloud cover?
3. How can we integrate data from multiple sources (satellites, ground sensors, UAVs) effectively?
4. What machine learning techniques will best predict fire spread based on terrain and environmental conditions?

### Establish User Stories / Visuals of UIs

**User Stories:**
1. As a fire manager, I want early detection of potential wildfires so I can deploy resources before fires become unmanageable
2. As an emergency coordinator, I want accurate fire spread predictions to plan evacuations effectively
3. As a firefighting team leader, I want optimal resource allocation recommendations based on fire behavior
4. As a local resident, I want real-time notifications about nearby fire risks
5. As a city planner, I want historical fire pattern data to improve community preparedness

**UI Mockups Needed:**
- Real-time fire detection dashboard with satellite and ground sensor integration
- Fire spread prediction visualization with time-based projections
- Resource allocation map showing optimal positioning of firefighting assets
- Mobile alert application for community notifications
- Historical fire pattern analysis interface

### API Endpoints that Correspond to User Stories

**Proposed Endpoints:**
1. `/api/detect-fires` - GET - Returns current fire detections from satellite and sensor data
2. `/api/predict-spread` - POST - Takes fire location and returns predicted spread patterns
3. `/api/historical-data` - GET - Returns historical fire patterns for specified regions
4. `/api/resource-optimization` - POST - Recommends optimal resource allocation
5. `/api/sensor-status` - GET - Returns status of ground-based sensors and cameras
6. `/api/alert-zones` - GET/POST - Manages community notification zones

### Database Model / Draw.io Diagrams to Support APIs

**Database Tables:**
1. `satellite_data` - Store processed satellite imagery and fire detections
2. `sensor_readings` - Store ground sensor network data
3. `weather_conditions` - Store real-time and forecast weather data
4. `terrain_data` - Store topographical information for fire spread modeling
5. `historical_fires` - Store information about past wildfire events
6. `resources` - Store information about available firefighting resources

**Relationships:**
- Satellite_data has many fire_detections
- Sensors have many sensor_readings
- Fire_detections connect to weather_conditions
- Fire_spread_predictions reference terrain_data
- Draw.io diagram needed to visualize these relationships
