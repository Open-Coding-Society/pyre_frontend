# Wildfire Prediction & Mitigation Detailed To-Do List

### **Initial** #33 
- [x] [Create Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/uCQ6ZWmPAA7XPklN5y5xLl/Pyre?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=rtwm9QlIyZXkDbiX-0)
- [x] Implement SASS 
- [ ] Create Neural Network/Facial Login
- [ ] [Implement User stories and User customization (Start working on Part 1)](#32)

### **1. Data Collection and Preparation** #34 
- [x] Load and inspect the wildfire dataset (e.g., satellite imagery, ground sensor data).
- [x] Verify the format of the dataset (CSV, GeoJSON, etc.) and ensure it’s clean.
- [x] Handle missing data by either filling or dropping it based on analysis.
- [x] Remove duplicates or irrelevant data points.
- [x] Identify and handle outliers that may skew results.

### **2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- [ ] Perform an initial analysis using `pandas` to understand data distribution.
- [ ] Clean and preprocess geospatial data (e.g., coordinates of wildfire locations, weather stations).
- [ ] Extract relevant features (e.g., wind speed, temperature, humidity, vegetation type).
- [ ] Normalize or standardize numerical features where necessary.
- [ ] Categorize temporal data (dates and times) and convert into usable formats.
  
### **3. Satellite Imagery & Remote Sensing Data**
- [ ] Collect and preprocess satellite images (MODIS, VIIRS, or Landsat [CSV]).
- [ ] Implement image processing techniques to enhance satellite data (e.g., image super-resolution for fire hotspots).
- [ ] Extract features from imagery (e.g., heatmaps, infrared signatures).
- [ ] Combine multiple sources of satellite data to improve detection accuracy and reduce latency.
- [ ] Use machine learning models to classify areas of interest (fire hotspots, smoke plumes).

### **4. Environmental and Meteorological Data Integration**
- [ ] Gather weather data (wind speed, temperature, humidity) and integrate with fire-related data.
- [ ] Map geographical features like terrain, vegetation, and water sources.
- [ ] Process environmental data to calculate fire risk based on historical conditions.
- [ ] Explore relationships between environmental data and fire occurrence (e.g., dry spells leading to increased fire risk).

### **5. Early Detection Models**
- [ ] Develop machine learning models for early fire detection (e.g., convolutional neural networks for smoke detection).
- [ ] Train and evaluate models for predicting fire ignition risk based on meteorological data.
- [ ] Implement real-time smoke detection using UAVs and ground-based sensors.
- [ ] Test models on historical wildfire datasets and tune for improved accuracy.

### **6. Fire Spread Simulation and Prediction**
- [ ] Model fire spread using physical-based models (e.g., FARSITE) and machine learning models (e.g., reinforcement learning).
- [ ] Integrate real-time data to simulate fire spread under various conditions (wind, terrain, humidity).
- [ ] Build predictive models using environmental inputs to estimate fire growth and direction.
- [ ] Test fire spread models on historical wildfire data for validation.
- [ ] Implement dynamic, real-time adjustments to the simulation based on live satellite and sensor data.

### **7. Wildfire Resource Allocation and Evacuation Plans**
- [ ] Develop an AI-powered resource allocation system for firefighting (e.g., deployment of teams, water drops, and aircraft).
- [ ] Create evacuation route planning systems using real-time fire data to recommend the safest routes.
- [ ] Implement multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for optimizing firefighting strategies.
- [ ] Simulate different firefighting strategies to identify the most efficient ones.
  
### **8. Correlation and Feature Analysis**
- [ ] Analyze correlations between wildfire spread and environmental features (wind speed, vegetation, etc.).
- [ ] Perform statistical analysis to understand how different factors influence fire behavior.
- [ ] Visualize correlations between satellite imagery, weather patterns, and fire locations.
- [ ] Build feature importance models to identify the most critical variables in wildfire prediction.

### **9. Wildfire Risk and Impact Assessment**
- [ ] Create a risk assessment model to predict areas with high likelihood of wildfires.
- [ ] Assess the potential damage by predicting fire impacts on infrastructure, communities, and wildlife.
- [ ] Develop a spatial model to predict the potential spread of wildfires and their impact on populated areas.
  
### **10. Data Visualization and Reporting**
- [ ] Create visualizations of satellite data to display wildfire hotspots and smoke patterns.
- [ ] Generate heatmaps and choropleth maps to represent wildfire risk areas across regions.
- [ ] Design interactive dashboards to display real-time data on wildfire activity and predictions.
- [ ] Build a reporting system to summarize predictions and wildfire behavior for decision-making authorities.

### **11. Model Deployment & Real-Time Monitoring**
- [ ] Deploy early detection models in real-time systems (e.g., using cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud).
- [ ] Set up a monitoring system to track the status of fire outbreaks and model predictions.
- [ ] Integrate weather data and fire risk models for continuous, adaptive predictions.
- [ ] Ensure the system can process new satellite data as soon as it becomes available for faster detection.

### **12. Validation and Model Evaluation**
- [ ] Validate all models using cross-validation techniques and historical data.
- [ ] Test the system’s predictions against actual wildfire occurrences and update models accordingly.
- [ ] Evaluate the system’s scalability and accuracy with large-scale wildfire datasets.
- [ ] Perform model performance tests to ensure high recall and precision in detecting fires and forecasting their spread.

### **13. Reporting and Feedback for Improvements**
- [ ] Analyze the results from the simulation and real-time monitoring systems.
