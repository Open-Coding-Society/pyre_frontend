# Digital Divide Study Guide
## AP Computer Science Principles - Big Idea 5

![Digital Divide Illustration](/api/placeholder/800/400 "An illustration showing the digital divide with people on opposite sides of a technological gap")

## What is the Digital Divide?

The **digital divide** refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology and those that don't or have restricted access.

### Key Dimensions of the Digital Divide:

1. **Access divide**: Physical access to technology and internet
2. **Usage divide**: Skills and capabilities to use technology effectively
3. **Quality divide**: Differences in connection speed, reliability, and devices
4. **Participation divide**: Ability to contribute to and benefit from digital resources

### Key Statistics:

- **Rural vs Urban Divide**: 
  - Rural Africa: 22% connectivity rate
  - Urban Africa: 76% connectivity rate

- **Regional Disparities**:
