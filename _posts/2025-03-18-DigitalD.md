# The Digital Divide: Understanding Inequities in the Digital Age

**AP Computer Science Principles - Big Idea 5.2**

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Define the digital divide and identify its key dimensions
- Analyze factors that contribute to digital inequality
- Evaluate the impact of the digital divide on different communities
- Propose potential solutions to bridge digital gaps

### Warm-Up Activity

**Digital Access Self-Assessment**

- How many internet-connected devices do you personally have access to?
- How would you rate your home internet speed/reliability (excellent, good, fair, poor)?
- Have you ever been unable to complete schoolwork due to technology limitations?
- Are there places you regularly visit where you can't get online?

Discussion: Share observations with a partner. What patterns do you notice in your classroom? Are there differences in access among students?

### Key Concepts

**What is the Digital Divide?**

- The digital divide refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology (ICT) and those that have limited or no access.

**Multiple Dimensions of the Digital Divide:**

- **Access Divide**
    - Physical access to devices and connectivity
    - Urban vs. rural disparities
    - Global North vs. Global South differences
- **Usage Divide**
    - Skills and literacy needed to use technology effectively
    - Purpose and nature of internet usage
    - Time and freedom to engage with technology
- **Quality Divide**
    - Speed and reliability of connections
    - Age and capabilities of devices
    - Infrastructure differences

**Contributing Factors:**

- Economic factors: Income inequality, cost of devices and services
- Geographic factors: Rural/urban differences, topography challenges
- Social factors: Age, education, language, disability
- Political factors: Government policies, censorship, investment priorities

### Data Exploration Activity

**Analyzing Real-World Digital Divide Data**

**Dataset 1: Global Internet Penetration Rates**

| Region        | Internet Users (%) | Smartphone Ownership (%) |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| North America | 92%                | 85%                      |
| Europe        | 87%                | 76%                      |
| Latin America | 72%                | 65%                      |
| Asia Pacific  | 54%                | 51%                      |
| Middle East   | 70%                | 60%                      |
| Africa        | 43%                | 33%                      |

**Dataset 2: Global Internet**

| Annual Income       | Broadband at Home | Smartphone Only | No Internet |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Less than $30,000   | 57%               | 27%             | 16%         |
| $30,000-$49,999     | 74%               | 15%             | 11%         |
| $50,000-$74,999     | 83%               | 13%             | 4%          |
| $75,000+            | 92%               | 6%              | 2%          |

Group Task:

- Identify the most significant disparities in your dataset
- Hypothesize what factors might be causing these gaps
- Consider what consequences these disparities might have for affected populations
- Prepare a brief summary of your findings to share with the class

### Impact Analysis

**How Does the Digital Divide Affect Different Aspects of Life?**

**Discussion Topics:**

- Education and learning opportunities
- Job opportunities and economic mobility
- Healthcare access and telemedicine
- Civic participation and engagement
- Cultural and social connection

Think-Pair-Share: With a partner, discuss how lacking digital access might affect:

- A student trying to complete coursework
- A job seeker looking for employment
- An elderly person needing healthcare during a pandemic
- A citizen wanting to participate in local government

### Bridging the Gap: Tech Solutions & Policy Approaches

- Individual Reflection: Write down 2-3 potential solutions to address aspects of the digital divide
- Small Group Collaboration: Form groups of 3-4 students. Combine your individual ideas and develop a more comprehensive solution that addresses multiple dimensions of the digital divide. Consider:
    - Technical solutions (infrastructure, devices)
    - Educational approaches (digital literacy)
    - Policy interventions (subsidies, regulations)
    - Community-based initiatives

### Case Study Analysis (15 minutes)

**Real-World Digital Divide Intervention**

**Case Study: The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) Initiative**

- The OLPC project aimed to provide low-cost laptops to children in developing countries. The program has deployed millions of laptops worldwide but has faced numerous challenges.

**Group Investigation:**

- What was the goal of this initiative?
- What technical approaches did they take? (durable design, low power usage, etc.)
- What successes did the program achieve?
- What challenges or criticisms emerged?
- What lessons can we learn about addressing the digital divide?

### Resources

- [Brief history of OLPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child)
- [Evaluation of OLPC programs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328118752_One_Laptop_Per_Child_OLPC_-_Strengths_and_Weaknesses)

### Key Takeaways

- The digital divide is multidimensional: access, usage, and quality
- Technology gaps affect economic, educational, and social opportunities
- Solutions require addressing both technical and social factors
- Both global and local approaches are needed

**Exit Ticket:**

On a note card or digital form, answer:

- One new thing you learned about the digital divide today
- One question you still have about digital inequality

### Homework Assignment

**Digital Divide Community Assessment**

- Observation: Identify a location in your community where people might need internet access but face barriers (examples: a library, community center, local business, apartment complex).
    - Who is using technology?
    - What devices are they using?
    - What are they using technology for?
    - Are there any visible barriers to access?

Due date: Next class session

Submission format: Please submit your observations, interview notes, and reflection paragraph through the class learning management system.
