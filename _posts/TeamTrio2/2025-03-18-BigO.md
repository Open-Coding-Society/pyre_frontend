# **Big O Notation & Algorithmic Efficiency**

## **Overview**
Understanding how algorithms perform as input size grows is crucial. We use **Big O notation** to describe their efficiency.
Big O notation helps us analyze:
- **Time Complexity**: How runtime increases with input size.
- **Space Complexity**: How much extra memory is needed.

---

### **What is Big O?**
Big O notation expresses the **worst-case scenario** runtime of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on how an algorithm behaves as the input size grows.

### **Common Big O Complexities**

| Complexity | Name | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant | `arr[0]` |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary Search |
| O(n) | Linear | Loop through an array |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge Sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Nested loops |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci |
| O(n!) | Factorial | Permutations |

## **Examples & Explanations**

### **Constant Time – O(1)**
```python
def get_first_element(arr):
    return arr[0]
```
**Takes the same amount of time, regardless of input size.**

Even if `arr` has 1 or 1,000,000 elements, this function always runs in one step.

---

### **Linear Time – O(n)**
```python
def print_elements(arr):
    for item in arr:
        print(item)
```
**Time grows proportionally with input size.**

If `arr` has 5 elements, we run the loop 5 times. If it has 1,000 elements, we run it 1,000 times.

---

### **Quadratic Time – O(n²)**
```python
def print_pairs(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            print(arr[i], arr[j])
```
**As `n` grows, operations increase quadratically.**

If `arr` has 10 elements, we perform 100 operations. If it has 100 elements, we perform 10,000 operations.

---

### **Logarithmic Time – O(log n)**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
**Efficient for searching in sorted data.**

Each step cuts the input size in half. Searching in 1,000,000 elements takes ~20 steps instead of 1,000,000.

---

### **Exponential Time – O(2ⁿ)**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
**Very slow for large `n`.**

For `n = 10`, this function does ~1000 calls. For `n = 50`, it does billions of calls.

---
## **Real-World Analogies**

Utilizing everyday scenarios can make abstract Big O concepts more relatable:

- O(1) – Constant Time Complexity: Imagine a vending machine where pressing a button dispenses a snack immediately, regardless of the number of snacks inside. Similarly, an algorithm with O(1) complexity performs its task in constant time, irrespective of input size. 
MBLOGING

- O(n) – Linear Time Complexity: Consider searching for a specific book in an unsorted stack by examining each one sequentially. The time taken grows linearly with the number of books, analogous to O(n) complexity.

- O(n²) – Quadratic Time Complexity: Think about organizing a round-robin tournament where each participant competes against every other participant once. As the number of participants increases, the number of matches grows quadratically, reflecting O(n²) complexity.

---
## **Common Misconceptions**

Clarifying prevalent misunderstandings can deepen comprehension:

- Big O Represents Exact Performance: A common misconception is that Big O notation provides the exact runtime of an algorithm. In reality, it describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate, indicating how performance scales with input size, not precise execution time. 

- Lower Big O Always Means Better Performance: While algorithms with lower time complexities generally perform better with large inputs, this isn't universally true. Factors like constant factors and lower-order terms can make an algorithm with higher complexity more efficient for smaller datasets.

- Big O is the only way to write time complexity: Big O notation describes the worst-case scenario, but variations of big O can describe it can also represent average and best-case complexities. However, worst-case analysis is typically emphasized to guarantee performance under all conditions.

- You include coefficients: you can calculate with coeffficnets when doing calculations - for example if you have two loops sequentially after one another that would technically be O(2n) but in practice we right it as O(n) as at large timescales it becomes irrelevant.

## Case Study

### 1. **Binary Search**
- **Big O Runtime:**
        - O(log n)
        - The list is halved at each step, so it takes about log₂(n) operations.
- **Number of Operations:**
        - For a list with 100 million elements:
                - log₂(100,000,000) ≈ 26.6 operations.
- **Estimated Runtime:**
        - Assuming each operation takes ~0.1 microseconds:
                - 26.6 × 0.1 μs ≈ 2.66 μs (microseconds).
- **Conditions:**
        - List must be sorted for binary search to work.
        - Reduces search space by half each iteration.

---

### 2. **Sequential Search (Linear Search)**
- **Big O Runtime:**
        - O(n)
        - In the worst case, it scans the entire list.
- **Number of Operations:**
        - In the worst case, it checks all 100 million elements.
- **Estimated Runtime:**
        - Assuming each operation takes ~0.1 microseconds:
                - 100,000,000 × 0.1 μs = 10,000,000 μs = 10 seconds.
- **Conditions:**
        - Works for unsorted lists.
        - Can be faster if the element is found early.

### **Comparison Summary:**

| Method            | Big O       | Number of Operations | Estimated Time |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Binary Search     | O(log n)    | ~27 operations       | ~2.7 microseconds |
| Sequential Search | O(n)        | 100 million operations | ~10 seconds |

**The time difference between 2.7 microseconds and 10 seconds is approximately 3.7 million times or about 6 orders of magnitude**

## How to Analyze Code for Time Complexity

When analyzing code for time complexity, ask yourself:

1. **Are there loops?**
   - A single loop over `n` elements is usually **O(n)**
   - Nested loops often indicate **O(n²)** or worse

2. **Are there recursive calls?**
   - Recursion can be **O(n)**, **O(log n)**, or **O(2ⁿ)** depending on how many times the function calls itself and how the input size shrinks

3. **Are there function calls inside loops?**
   - Watch out for things like `list.append()` (O(1)) vs. `list.insert(0, x)` (O(n))

4. **Are we accessing data structures?**
   - Accessing:
     - Array/List element → **O(1)**
     - Dictionary/Set lookup → **O(1)**
   - Searching/sorting may be more expensive

5. **What’s the dominant term?**
   - Drop constants and less significant terms (e.g., `O(n + n²)` becomes **O(n²)**)

## Space Complexity (brief)

Space complexity is how much **extra memory** your algorithm uses as input grows. The examples here are the most common ones but others do exist - much rarer in practice.

### What to look for:
- **New variables or data structures**
  - E.g., `arr = [0] * n` → O(n)
- **Recursion**
  - Each recursive call adds to the call stack
- **Input vs. Output**
  - Returning a new list instead of modifying the original list can increase space usage

### Examples:
```python
def double_list(nums):
    return [x * 2 for x in nums]
```
- Space Complexity: O(n) – a new list is created

```python
def in_place_double(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] *= 2
```
- Space Complexity: O(1) – no new list, modifies in place

### Rule of Thumbs:
- If you're creating new lists, maps, or arrays, you're using extra space → O(n)
- If you're modifying in place or using a fixed number of variables → O(1)

## MCQ Questions

---
### Question 1
**Question:**
A company delivers packages by truck and would like to minimize the length of the route that each driver must travel in order to reach **n** delivery locations. The company is considering two different algorithms for determining delivery routes.

*Algorithm I*
Generate all possible routes, compute their lengths, and then select the shortest possible route. This algorithm does not run in reasonable time.
*Algorithm II*
Starting from an arbitrary delivery location, find the nearest unvisited delivery location. Continue creating the route by selecting the nearest unvisited location until all locations have been visited. This algorithm does not guarantee the shortest possible route and runs in time proportional to **n^2**.

**Options:**
- A: Algorithm II attempts to use an algorithmic approach to solve an otherwise undecidable problem.
- B: Algorithm II uses a heuristic approach to provide an approximate solution in reasonable time.
- C: Algorithm II provides no improvement over algorithm I because neither algorithm runs in reasonable time.
- D: Algorithm II requires a much faster computer in order to provide any improvement over algorithm I.

**Answer**: Option B
**Explanation:** Algorithm II runs in time proportional to n^2, which is considered reasonable time because n^2 is a polynomial. This is considered a heuristic approach because it finds an approximate solution in reasonable time when the technique that finds an exact solution (algorithm I) does not run in reasonable time.
**Notes:**
- Unreasonable time: An algorithm that runs in a time - that is simply not practical for use or breaks the systems in some way.
- Heurestic: A general guideline for something, heustics are oftne used when the problem is either unsolvable or just used as general rules to find a good answer (may not be perfect)

### Rough Guidelines on Input Size

**"Reasonable":**
- O(1) | Any size — instant
- O(log n) | Millions — very efficient
- O(n) | Up to ~10⁷
- O(n log n) | Up to ~10⁶ - 10⁷
- O(n²) | Up to ~10³ - 10⁴

**"Unreasonable":**
- O(2ⁿ) | Usually breaks around n = 20-25
- O(n!) | Unreasonable after n = 10

---

### Question 2
**Question:**
Consider the following algorithms. Each algorithm operates on a list containing n elements, where n is a very large integer.

I. An algorithm that accesses each element in the list twice
II. An algorithm that accesses each element in the list n times
III. An algorithm that accesses only the first 10 elements in the list, regardless of the size of the list

Which of the algorithms run in reasonable time?

**Options:**
- A: I Only
- B: II Only
- C: I and II Only
- D: I, II, and III

**Answer**: Option D
**Explanation:** For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements 2n times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses n^2 elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time. (Refer to table from Q1 for what's generally considered "reasonable")
**Notes:**
- The concept of "unreasonable" is hard to define as it defines largely on the problem, the user, and the situation as in some scenarios, perhaps a run time of 5 seconds with a complexity of O(n^2) could be considered "unreasonable" if the input size is large for some usecases. But in other scenarios that same complexity and run time could be consdered "reasonable" - its largely based on the context. BUT for COLLEGEBOARD anythign until O(n^2) is typically considered reasonable.

### Other types of "Algorithmic Efficiency Questions" (3.17):
- Will ask you to calculate the time difference between two algorithms given the amount of time it takes for one instance of the function to run, typically to find the answer just count/calculate the number of times that certain function is run and then perform basic arithmetic to find difference.
- Will be some variation of the problems we ahve shown above :)

## **Curious? Extensions of Big O**
