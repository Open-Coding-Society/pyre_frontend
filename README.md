# CSP Tri 3 - Pilot City Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to our AP Computer Science Principles Trimester 3 repository! The main focus of this project is the Qualcomm Autonomous Vehicle Navigation Enhancement (Pilot City).

### Qualcomm Autonomous Vehicle Navigation Enhancement

We're developing a machine learning application that leverages Poway's Open Data Portal transportation data to enhance autonomous vehicle navigation. Our goal is to reduce travel time by 20% for local commuters through:

- Predictive traffic flow models
- Real-time route optimization algorithms
- Adaptive speed control systems

This project showcases Qualcomm's cutting-edge technology in real-world scenarios while addressing practical transportation challenges in our community.

## Repository Structure

This project is split across two repositories:

- Backend Repository: Contains API endpoints, ML models, and data processing
- Frontend Repository: Contains user interfaces, visualization components, and API integrations

## Project Timeline

- **Week 1 (March 12-21)**: Discovery, Planning, Setup, and Titanic Model Adaptation
- **March 23 - April 12**: Pilot City Data Integration
- **March 23 - April 19**: ML Model Development
- **March 30 - April 19**: Backend Development
- **April 6 - April 26**: Frontend Development
- **April 27 - May 10**: Integration Testing
- **May 11 - May 20**: User Testing
- **May 21 - May 30**: Refinement
- **May 31 - June 4**: Final Deployment
- **June 5 - June 9**: Final Evaluation

## Key Features

1. **Traffic Prediction System**
   - Forecasts congestion based on historical patterns
   - Incorporates weather and event data
   - Provides both short-term and long-term predictions

2. **Route Optimization Engine**
   - Dynamically calculates optimal routes
   - Considers multiple parameters (time, distance, fuel efficiency)
   - Learns from past journeys to improve accuracy

3. **Adaptive Speed Control**
   - Recommends optimal speeds based on traffic flow
   - Predicts traffic light timing
   - Calculates safe following distances

4. **User Interfaces**
   - Web dashboard for administrators
   - Mobile app for commuters
   - Vehicle HUD interface

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the backend repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-team/csp-tri3-pilot-city-backend.git
   cd csp-tri3-pilot-city-backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. **Clone the frontend repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/examplelink.git
 
   ```

2. **Use the Makefile to set up and run:**
   ```
   make
   ```
